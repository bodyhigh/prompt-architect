# Prompt Architect v2.3.0 — Threewire Systems

*A spec‑only scaffolding that turns Agile habits (stories, AC, Gherkin) into reliable prompts.*

**Audience:** mixed technical/non‑technical. **Tone:** plain English. **Output usage:** copy‑paste into ChatGPT (or similar).

---

## 1) Quick Start

### Choose a version

- **Lite** – fastest, minimal, no policy toggles. Use for agendas, short specs, emails, simple lists.
- **Full** – adds guardrails (PII/PHI masking, CUI markings), verification scaffolding, and iteration notes. Use for security/compliance/customer deliverables, or anything you’d normally pair with acceptance criteria and tests.

### Workflow (both versions)

1. Answer the **Intake Gate** (Objective, Audience & Format, Inputs) or say “use defaults.”
2. Wait for the agent to acknowledge: **“ACK: intake complete.”** Without a complete intake, it will not draft.
3. The scaffold returns a **Spec Overview**, a **Final Prompt Blueprint**, Quick Tests, and a Verification Plan (plus Iteration Notes & Explain Why in Full).
4. Copy/paste the Final Prompt Blueprint into a **new chat** to run it. Iterate with diff‑only feedback using natural triggers like “revise”, “add X”, or “remove Y.”

**Strict Mode:** Enabled by default. It enforces the intake gate, non‑execution guarantee, audit trace, and fail‑closed behaviour.

## 2) Experimental Features

The following features are available but may have side effects. Confidence levels indicate how reliable each is in practice.

| Feature | Confidence | Pros | Cons / Risks | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CUI Marking | Medium | Compliance cues | Formatting burden | Off |
| PII/PHI Masking | Medium | Reduces leakage | Pattern misses edge cases | Off |
| Natural‑language Revisions | High | Easier iteration | May misfire on vague asks | On |
| Downstream Ephemeral Memory | Medium | Convenience | Context bleed if reused improperly | On |
| Audit Trace JSON | High | Provenance | Slight token cost | On |
| Strict Mode | High | Safety & consistency | Stricter refusals | On |

## 3) Section Reference (Lite)

The Lite scaffold produces a concise **Spec Overview** and a **Final Prompt Blueprint** with these sections:

`<role> <task> <context> <constraints> <instructions> <output_format> <quality_checks>`

| Section | Purpose | What to write | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<role>` | Sets the model’s POV so outputs match your expectations. | Job/hat you want the model to wear. | `You are a release manager for an enterprise .NET API.` |
| `<task>` | States the single deliverable to produce now. | Short imperative goal; avoid multi‑asks. | `Produce a rollout plan with milestones and a risk table.` |
| `<context>` | Supplies facts the model should assume. | Who, environment, inputs, constraints, success criteria. | `AUDIENCE: mixed; INPUTS: none; SUCCESS: tables present, tests included.` |
| `<constraints>` | Scopes the output so it’s reviewable. | Word limits, formats, forbidden items. | `≤600 words; Markdown tables only; avoid speculation.` |
| `<instructions>` | Step‑by‑step method to follow. | Mini recipe the model must execute. | `Normalize inputs → resolve conflicts → produce sections → add 3 quick tests.` |
| `<output_format>` | Final shape for copy/paste. | Required sections, exact table columns. | `Return 2 tables: Milestones and Risks (Risk, Likelihood, Impact, Mitigation, Owner).` |
| `<quality_checks>` | Built‑in “Definition of Done.” | Review gates the model must self‑confirm. | `Coverage; traceability to inputs; clarity; verification steps; prioritized next actions.` |

**Lite meta blocks (appear in the spec, not in the Final Prompt Blueprint):**

- `<mode>` — **Purpose:** Enforces spec‑only, strict mode, and the non‑execution guarantee.
- `<intake_gate>` — **Purpose:** Blocks drafting until all three essentials are present; no objective default.
- `<defaults>` — **Purpose:** Safe fallbacks when the user says **“use defaults.”**
- `<drafting_protocol>`, `<output_contract>`, `<feedback>`, `<helper_examples_when_objective_missing>`, `<trace_json>` — **Purpose:** Keep runs consistent, handle revisions, and capture audit data.

## 4) Section Reference (Full)

The Full scaffold includes the same core sections and adds:

| Section | Extra power in Full | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `<examples>` | Include **[SAMPLE]** only (no real PII/PHI). Anchors structure/style. | `<examples>[SAMPLE] Provide a table: 'Item', 'Owner', 'Due', 'Notes'</examples>` |
| `<quality_checks>` | May include policy conformance checks. | `PII leak check = zero; CUI banners present when enabled.` |
| `<trace_json>` | Always emitted for audit. | `{ "run_id": "...", "timestamp": "...", ... }` |
| `<iteration_notes>` | Suggests targeted improvements for the next revision. | `Try adding a risk table; adjust word limit.` |
| `<explain_why>` | Explains the rationale behind the blueprint for user learning. | `This structure maximizes clarity and repeatability.` |

The Full version also supports policy toggles for PII masking and CUI marking, a more detailed verification plan, and an iteration loop using natural‑language triggers.

## 5) Tips & Anti‑Patterns

- Fence code/logs/long quotes with triple backticks.
- Ask for downloadable files when copy/paste is flaky.
- Use Projects/threads; keep artifacts grouped and named.
- Ask the model to list **facts, assumptions, and unknowns** before finalizing.
- Draft prompts in an editor to avoid accidental submit and to version your asks.

**Avoid**:
- “Do everything about X” (scope balloon)
- “Make it detailed” (without constraints)
- Missing inputs (“use your best guess”)
- Unverifiable asks (no success criteria)

---

## 6) Examples

- **EAMS‑A Migration (Full):** rollout plan + M/H risks + G/W/T → endpoints; constraint: **no refresh tokens**.
- **Prod SSL Certificates (Lite):** request → install → verify (`openssl`), include rollback and owners; ≤300 words.
- **Weekly Agenda (Lite):** timeboxes, owners, decision prompts, and a decision log table.

## 8) Archive & Recipes

**Archive** – Deep research assessments live in `/assessments/`. Each file follows the pattern `<repo>-assessment-v<version>.md` and contains a comprehensive report with scorecards, UX plans, and recommendations. Example: [prompt-architect-assessment-v2.3.0](assessments/prompt-architect-assessment-v2.3.0.md).

### Recipes

Use these **Narrative Asks** with **Prompt Architect — Lite or Full**.  
Tip: When Architect asks its 3 intake questions, paste the recipe’s block as your answer.

#### Recipe 1 — Deep Research: Repository Assessment (GitHub)

**Purpose**: Evidence-based, static assessment of a GitHub repo with scorecard, UX test plan, and tiered recommendations.

**Narrative Ask**  
Objective: Produce a static, evidence-based assessment of a GitHub repository suitable for leadership and engineers. Include: (1) purpose restatement, (2) Fit-to-Ask verdict (Yes/No/Partial) with 2–4 evidence bullets, (3) AI Agent Capability Scorecard (0–5) with Score/Why/Evidence/Action≤3, (4) UX Walkthrough Test Plan (≥12 scenarios with steps, expected, data to capture, acceptance), (5) end‑user intuitiveness + Lite Disclosure Matrix, (6) feedback/memory/audit review (current→target→gaps), (7) tiered improvements (Minor/Moderate/Major/Full Redesign) with impact/complexity/risks/migration, (8) verification plan and references.  
Audience & Output format: Senior engineer & product owner; Markdown report.  
Inputs available:
- repo_url: `<PASTE GITHUB REPO URL>`
- branch: `main`
- connectors: GitHub (read‑only).  
Notes: Static analysis only (no code execution). Cite non-obvious claims to specific files/lines; quotes ≤25 words. Record default branch + latest commit hash/date.

**Connectors used**: GitHub  
**Scope**: Static analysis only; no builds/runners.

#### Recipe 2 — Requirements Synthesis from a Google Drive Folder

**Purpose**: Turn a folder of notes/specs into a single, source‑cited PRD draft.

**Narrative Ask**  
Objective: Synthesize a concise Product Requirements Draft (PRD) from a Google Drive folder of notes/specs. Output sections: Problem, Users/Jobs, In/Out of Scope, Flows, Acceptance Criteria, Risks, Open Questions, References. Inline‑cite each claim to Drive file + heading.  
Audience & Output format: Product/engineering leads; Markdown PRD.  
Inputs available:
- drive_folder: `<PASTE DRIVE FOLDER LINK/ID>`
- connectors: Google Drive (read‑only).  
Notes: Static synthesis only; preserve ambiguity as “Unknowns” with how‑to‑verify steps. Quote ≤25 words; otherwise paraphrase.

**Connectors used**: Google Drive  
**Scope**: Read‑only docs; no external tools.

#### Recipe 3 — Local Files Quick Audit (Security & Licenses)

**Purpose**: Scan a local file set (zipped or uploaded) for obvious security smells and license headers; produce a punch‑list.

**Narrative Ask**  
Objective: Perform a static quick audit of uploaded project files for (a) obvious security smells (hard‑coded secrets, wide CORS, missing HTTPS mentions), and (b) OSS license headers/presence. Output a punch‑list with severity (H/M), file:line cites, and a short “How to verify” step per finding.  
Audience & Output format: Engineering; Markdown checklist.  
Inputs available:
- local_files: (uploaded archive or files in chat)
- connectors: Local Files.  
Constraints: Static scan only; no execution. Prefer primary file cites. Mask sensitive strings.

**Connectors used**: Local Files  
**Scope**: Static content inspection only.

#### chatgpt.com Scope Guardrails (applies to all recipes)

- ✅ **Allowed**: GitHub, Google Drive, Local Files connectors (read‑only); limited web lookups of primary standards.  
- 🚫 **Exclude**: Custom runtimes, code execution, background jobs, long‑running crawlers, unsupported external services.  
- 🔒 **Privacy**: Redact PII/PHI; best‑effort masking only.  
- 🤖 **Static only**: No builds, no tests, no infra changes — analysis and synthesis are fine.

#### Why a Narrative Ask?

- **Novices**: A short paragraph is easier; Architect turns it into a **Final Prompt Blueprint**.  
- **Power users**: Keep predefined templates in `/templates/`.
